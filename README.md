This repository contains an Excel file for analyzing and visualizing electric vehicle market data.

# OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize electric vehicle (EV) data from various counties in Washington State. The data used in this project includes information on electric vehicles such as make, model, year, electric range, base MSRP, and geographic location within Washington State. By providing a detailed and interactive dashboard, this project aims to enhance the understanding of electric vehicle adoption and support efforts to promote sustainable transportation solutions.

# KPIs
- Average Electric Range
- Total Number of Electric Vehicles
- Distribution by Electric Vehicle Type
- Average Base MSRP
- CAFV Eligibility Rate
- Top 5 Vehicle Makes
- Top 5 Vehicle Models
- Vehicle Distribution by Model Year

# Key Observations
- The high count of electric vehicles highlights the significant adoption of electric vehicles within Washington State.This also indicates a strong market presence and a robust infrastructure supporting EV 
  ownership.
- The average range suggests that while electric vehicles are suitable for daily commuting and short trips, they might face limitations for longer journeys, without access to charging infrastructure. This 
  highlights the importance of expanding charging stations and infrastructure to support the growing adoption of electric vehicles.
